I Successfully completed a practical exercise on using 
and evaluating a VPN service.  
The steps I followed include: 
1. Selected and signed up for a reputable free VPN service. 
2.Downloaded and installed the VPN client on my device. 
3.Connected to a VPN server, selecting a nearby or preferred location. 
4.Verified the IP address change using whatismyipaddress.com to 
confirm VPN routing was active. 
5.Browsed websites to confirm traffic was encrypted 
(checked for HTTPS lock icons and secure connections). 
6.Disconnected the VPN to compare browsing speed and IP address 
changes, observing the differences in speed and location exposure. 
7.Researched VPN encryption and privacy features, 
including protocols like WireGuard, OpenVPN, and their security 
benefits. 
8.Summarized the key benefits and limitations of VPNs: 
Benefits: 
Enhances online privacy, hides IP address, secures data transmission, 
bypasses geo-restrictions. 
Limitations: 
Potential speed reduction, limited features in free VPNs, some VPN 
providers may log data, and not all VPNs prevent IP leaks like 
WebRTC or DNS by default.
